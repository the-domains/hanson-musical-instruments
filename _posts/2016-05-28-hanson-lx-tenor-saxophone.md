Hanson LX tenor saxophone. 

The LX tenor is everything you could wish for in a late 1950's Selmer 'MKVI' but without the 60 years of wear and tear. The sound and feel is just right; our keys sit perfectly under your fingers and the LX takes you back in time.

**This is the best of everything a 'vintage' sax has to offer with the precision of a modern horn.**
