Hanson LX tenor saxophone. 

The LX tenor is everything you could wish for in a late 1950's Selmer 'MKVI' but without the 60 years of wear and tear. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/19eca335-2be8-442c-95cd-b04684937956.jpg)

The sound and feel is just right; our keys sit perfectly under your fingers and the LX takes you back in time.
